<h3 align="center">I'm interested in doing stupid things!</h3>

I'm a undergraduate student of Computer Science at the University of Michigan and an Undergraduate Research Assistant at [SLED lab](https://sled.eecs.umich.edu/) and [VisionX](https://www.sainingxie.com/). Before transferring to the University of Michigan, I'm a student at the University of Nottingham, pursuing B.S. CS with AI. I'm interested in unsupervised/self-supervised learning and generative models, also interested in doing stupid things. [Feedbacks](https://forms.gle/kpGov9XbjaQoSiyh7) are always welcome~

My research journey began with a strong focus on generative models in computer vision, particularly in generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models. Currently, my work has expanded to encompass a broader range of topics, including computer vision, natural language processing, 3D models and robotics. 

I think I will focus on the following topics from **first principles** and **Occam's razor** in the future:

- **Multimodal Representation Learning, especially in unsupervised methods.**

- **Causal Generative Model, not only just about autoregressive models or diffusion models.**

- **Machine Learning, something more than current learning approaches.**
